					An array is a consecutive group of memory locations that all have the same name and the same type.
					There are two types of arrays in Visual Basic namely:
					Fixed-size array : The size of array always remains the same-size doesn't change during the program execution.
					Dynamic array : The size of the array can be changed at the run time- size changes during the program execution.
